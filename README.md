### Some tests, tools and examples
What we have now : 
> - **VoronoiSplitScreen / Mask**:
Simple implementation of [this talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tu-Qe66AvtY) about a dynamic split screen using Voronoi.
Got a little lost, now waiting for latest OpenFL support where it should be a lot easier to draw to camera.
> - **Jumps**:
Simple implementation of [this talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hG9SzQxaCm8) about how to build easier to tweak jumps.
> - **CastleDB**:
HaxeFlixel example to use [CastleDB](https://github.com/ncannasse/castle) and [CastleDB's level editor](http://castledb.org/#level).

More to come!
